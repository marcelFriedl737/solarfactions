# Solar Factions - Game Concept

## Overview
Solar Factions is a minimal text, dialog, and table-based sci-fi simulation featuring a 2D map of space populated with ships, stations, and asteroids. The game emphasizes emergent gameplay through autonomous AI actors and data-driven mechanics centered around trading, production, mining, and combat.

## Core Design Principles

### Data-Driven Architecture
- All game entities, behaviors, and mechanics defined through structured data files
- Modular systems allowing easy expansion and modification
- Statistical and probabilistic models driving all interactions

### Tick-Based Simulation
- Game progresses in discrete time units (ticks)
- Each tick represents a standardized time period (hours, days, or weeks)
- All actions resolve simultaneously at tick boundaries
- Predictable, turn-based feel despite real-time appearance

### Autonomous Actor System
- Every entity is an independent actor with goals, personality, and decision-making
- Simulation continues and evolves without player intervention
- Emergent narratives arise from actor interactions

## Game World

### 2D Space Map
- Grid-based or continuous 2D coordinate system
- Contains various space objects:
  - **Ships**: Mobile units with various purposes (cargo, mining, combat, exploration)
  - **Stations**: Fixed installations (trading posts, refineries, shipyards, habitats)
  - **Asteroids**: Minable resources with varying compositions
  - **Planets**: Major population and production centers
  - **Jump Gates**: Enable fast travel between distant regions

### Regions and Territories
- Space divided into sectors controlled by different factions
- Control affects trade routes, taxation, and security
- Contested zones with shifting boundaries
- Resource-rich areas become focal points for conflict

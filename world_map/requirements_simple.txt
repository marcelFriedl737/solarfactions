# Minimal requirements for simplified Solar Factions system
# Only the essential dependencies needed for core functionality

# Core rendering and interaction
pygame>=2.0.0

# Testing (optional for development)
pytest>=7.0.0

# Note: We removed the following dependencies to reduce complexity:
# - pydantic (complex validation)
# - numpy (overkill for simple 2D coordinates)
# - matplotlib (too heavy for simple visualization)
# - pyyaml (JSON is sufficient)
# - jsonschema (manual validation is simpler)

# The entire system now runs with just pygame for rendering
# Everything else uses Python standard library
